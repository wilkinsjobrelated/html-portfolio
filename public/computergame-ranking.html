<h3>Dota 2</h3>
<p>At first, I dont like this game because I need to adjust from transition of graphics from Dota 1 to Dota 2.<br/> Right now, it's my stress-reliever.</p>

<h3>Dota1</h3>
<p>A nostalgic game where friendship and funny moments unite us.<br/> I'm one of the best players in our school during Junior high days.</p>

<p>First game I played in computer. Even though I got low grades at grade school<br/> but I don't regret anything from it.</p>
